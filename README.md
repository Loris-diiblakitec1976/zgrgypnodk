Hey, just stepped out of the theater. Opus, man, talk about a brain blender. Or a reality blender? Hmm, popcorn everywhere, and my back's kinda sore from those sticky, squeaky seats. Did they even vacuum in there?? Oh, but the colors! Vibrant like when you accidentally pour skittles into a bowl of soup. Yeah, like that — but with sound. Crazy sound, like mixing dubstep with a bird chirp orchestra. 

Right, the plot. So, there's this guy...erring on the side of mysterious, like when my phone randomly goes into airplane 𝘮𝘰𝘥e. He seemed to float through scenes like a marshmallow cloud, like the marshmallows I grabbed too fast at the concession stand and barely tasted.

> This moment where, I think it was a dream sequence? Or was I dreaming? The floors turned into waves, people surfing down them like it's nothing, reminding me of when I tried skateboarding and ended up hugging a dumpster. Characters, too, seemed to slide in and out of existence the way a half-eaten pizza slice morphs into breakfast. Have you ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 pizza become breakfast? Feels surreal, like this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮!

Noise, so much noise, like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 all 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯s of a cartoon in fast forward. I needed 𝘴𝘶𝘣𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦s for the 𝘴𝘶𝘣𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦s. Gotta remember who asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , was it Mike or... maybe John? But seriously, it had this hypnotic pull — a need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, like a second serving of fries before realizing they’re cold and kinda disappointing.

Ah! That scene with all the mirrors, it doubled and tripled the faces until I couldn't recognize them anymore, like those nightmares where your hands turn to bird claws... wait, does anyone else dream that??

Anyway, what was I saying? Hair of the dog cocktails, yeah? Imagine them as scenes from Opus. Layered, indistinct, yet somehow you feel them settling in your bones. Cinematic hangover, maybe. Did my friend walk out after 30 minutes? He missed that mind-bending cliffhanger — though calling it a cliffhanger is like calling a five-car pile-up a fender bender.

If only seats were bread rolls, comfy, soft, and kneadable. I'd almost consider 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the concept of comfort next time I plan a binge. 

JavaScript, totally unrelated but here’s this: 
```javascript
function illusionArray() {
   let mirage = 'echo';
   for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      mirage += ' ' + i;
   }
   return mirage;
}
// Why was this here again? 
```
